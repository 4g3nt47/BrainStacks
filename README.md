# BrainStacks

![](/preview.jpg)

**BrainStacks** is a simple front-end web application built with Svelte. It is used to create flash cards with questions and answers, and can be grouped into many different categories. *BrainStacks* does not have a backend, so all flash cards are stored in the browser of users using *local storage*.

This is my first project with Svelte, and it was fun because I got to use features like;

- Reusable components
- Reactive values
- Event handling and forwarding
- Transitions and animations

## Technologies
